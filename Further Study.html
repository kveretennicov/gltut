    <p>This book provides a firm foundation for you to get started in your adventures as a
        graphics programmer. However, it ultimately cannot cover everything. What follows will be a
        general overview of other topics that you should investigate now that you have a general
        understanding of how graphics work.</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e13056"></a>Debugging</h2></div></div></div>
        
        
        <p>This book provides functioning code to solve various problems and implement a variety
            of effects. However, it does not talk about how to get code from a non-working state
            into a working one. That is, debugging.</p>
        <p>Debugging OpenGL code is very difficult. Frequently when there is a bug in graphics
            code, the result is a massively unhelpful blank screen. If the problem is localized to a
            single shader or state used to render an object, the result is a black object or general
            garbage. Compounding this problem is the fact that OpenGL has a lot of global state. One
            of the reasons this book will often bind objects, do something with them, and then
            unbind them, is to reduce the amount of state dependencies. It ensures that every object
            is rendered with a specific program, a set of textures, a certain VAO, etc. It may be
            slightly slower to do this, but for a simple application, getting it working is more
            important.</p>
        <p>Debugging shaders is even more problematic; there are no breakpoints or watches you
            can put on GLSL shaders. Fragment shaders offer the possibility of
                <code class="function">printf</code>-style debugging: one can always write some values to the
            framebuffer and see something. Vertex or other shader stages require passing their data
            through another stage before the outcome can be seen. And even then, it is an
            interpolated version.</p>
        <p>Because of the difficulty in debugging, the general tactics for doing so revolve
            around bug prevention rather than bug finding. Therefore, the most important tactic for
            debugging is this: always start with working code. Begin development with something that
            actually functions, even if it is not drawing what you ultimately intend for it to. Once
            you have working code, you can change it to render what you need it to.</p>
        <p>The second tip is to minimize the amount of code/data that could be causing any
            problem you encounter. This means making small changes in a working application and
            immediately testing to see if they work or not. If they do not, then it must be because
            of those small changes. If you make big changes, then the size of the code/data you have
            to look through is much larger. The more code you have to debug, the harder it is to do
            so effectively.</p>
        <p>Along with the last tip is to use a distributed version control system and check in
            your code often, preferably after each small change. This will allow you to revert any
            changes that do not work, as well as see the actual differences between the last working
            version and the now non-functional version. This will save you from inadvertent
            keystrokes and the like.</p>
        <p>The next step is to avail yourself of debugging tools, where they exist for your
            platform(s) of interest. OpenGL itself can help here. The OpenGL specification defines
            what functions should do in the case of malformed input. Specifically, they will place
            errors into the OpenGL error queue. After every OpenGL function call, you may want to
            check to see if an error has been added to the queue. This is done with code as
            follows:</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">for(GLenum currError = glGetError(); currError != GL_NO_ERROR; currError = glGetError())
{
  //Do something with `currError`.
}</pre>
        <p>It would be very tedious to put this after every function. But since the errors are
            all stored in a queue, they are not associated with the actual function that caused the
            error. If <code class="function">glGetError</code> is not called frequently, it becomes very
            difficult to know where any particular error came from. Therefore, there is a special
            OpenGL extension specifically for aiding in debugging: ARB_debug_output. This extension
            is only available when creating an OpenGL context with a special debug flag. The
            framework used here automatically uses this extension in debug builds.</p>
        <p>The debug output extension allows the user to register a function that will be called
            whenever errors happen. It can also be called when less erroneous circumstances occur;
            this depends on the OpenGL implementation. When set up for synchronous error messages,
            the callback will be called before the function that created the error returned. So it
            is possible to breakpoint inside the callback function and see exactly which function
            caused it.</p>
        <p>Setting up the callback is somewhat complex. The Unofficial OpenGL SDK offers, as part
            of its GL Utilities sub-library, a registration function for setting up the debug output
            properly. Also, the framework for this book's code offers similar functionality. It is
            located in <code class="filename">framework/framework.cpp</code>.</p>
        <p>There are alternatives for catching OpenGL errors. The utility glIntercept (it works
            in Linux and Windows, but the Linux port is slightly iffy) is capable of hooking into
            OpenGL without any code modifications and tracking every OpenGL function call. It can
            dump every OpenGL call to a file, as well as the given parameters. This is very useful
            for debugging, as it tells you more about what may have caused certain error or visual
            glitches. It also automatically checks for errors after every function call, alleviating
            the need to do so manually. Any errors are logged with the function that produced
            them.</p>
        <p>The gDebugger tool, Windows only, offers similar features, though unlike glIntercept,
            it is not open-source.</p>
