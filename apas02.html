        <p>There are various techniques you can use to improve the performance of texture
            accesses.</p>

            <p>The smaller the data, the faster it can be fetched into a shader. As with vertex
                formats, try to use the smallest format that you can get away with. As with vertex
                formats, what you can get away with tends to be defined by what you are trying to
                store in the texture.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Normals.&nbsp;</b>
                Textures containing normals can use <code class="literal">GL_RGB10_A2_SNORM</code>,
                    which is the texture equivalent to the 10-bit signed normalized format we used
                    for attribute normals. However, this can be made more precise if the normals are
                    for a tangent-space normal map. Since the tangent-space normals always have a
                    positive Z coordinate, and since the normals are normalized, the actual Z value
                    can be computed from the other two. So you only need to store 2 values;
                        <code class="literal">GL_RG16_SNORM</code> is sufficient for these needs. To compute
                    the third value, do this:
            </p>
            <pre class="programlisting">vec2 norm2d = texture(tangentBumpTex, texCoord).xy;
vec3 tanSpaceNormal = vec3(norm2d, sqrt(1.0 - dot(norm2d, norm2d)));</pre>
            <p>Obviously this costs some performance, so it's a question of how much precision
                you actually need. On the plus side, using this method means that you will not have
                to normalize the tangent-space normal fetched from the texture.</p>
            <p>The <code class="literal">GL_RG16_SNORM</code> format can be made even smaller with texture
                compression. The <code class="literal">GL_COMPRESSED_SIGNED_RG_RGTC1</code> compressed texture
                format is a 2-channel signed integer format. It only takes up 8-bits per
                pixel.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Floating-point Intensity.&nbsp;</b>
                There are two unorthodox formats for floating-point textures, both of which
                    have important uses. The <code class="literal">GL_R11F_G11F_B10F</code> format is
                    potentially a good format to use for HDR render targets. As the name suggests,
                    it takes up only 32-bits. The downside is the relative loss of precision
                    compared to <code class="literal">GL_RGB16F</code> (as well as the complete loss of a
                    destination alpha). They can store approximately the same magnitude of values,
                    but the smaller format loses some precision. This may or may not impact the
                    overall visual quality of the scene. It should be fairly simple to test to see
                    which is better.
            </p>
            <p>The <code class="literal">GL_RGB9_E5</code> format is used for input floating-point
                textures. If you have a texture that represents light intensity in HDR situations,
                this format can be quite handy. The way it works is that each of the RGB colors get
                9 bits for their values, but they all share the same exponent. This has to do with
                how floating-point numbers work, but what it boils down to is that the values have
                to be relatively close to one another in magnitude. They do not have to be that
                close; there's still some leeway. Values that are too small relative to larger ones
                become zero. This is oftentimes an acceptable tradeoff, depending on the particular
                magnitude in question.</p>
            <p>This format is useful for textures that are generated offline by tools. You cannot
                render to a texture in this format.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Colors.&nbsp;</b>
                Storing colors that are clamped to [0, 1] can be done with good precision with
                        <code class="literal">GL_RGBA8</code> or <code class="literal">GL_SRGB8_ALPHA8</code> as needed.
                    However, compressed texture formats are available. The S3TC formats are good
                    choices if the compression artifacts are not too noticable. There are sRGB
                    versions of the S3TC formats as well.
            </p>
            <p>The difference in the various S3TC formats are how much alpha you need. The
                choices are as follows:</p>
            <div class="glosslist"><dl><dt><span class="glossterm">GL_COMPRESSED_RGB_S3TC_DXT1_EXT</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>No alpha.</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA_S3TC_DXT1_EXT</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>Binary alpha. Either zero or one for each texel. The RGB color for any
                            texel with a zero alpha will also be zero.</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA_S3TC_DXT3_EXT</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>4-bits of alpha per pixel.</p></dd><dt><span class="glossterm">GL_COMPRESSED_RGBA_S3TC_DXT5_EXT</span></dt><dd class="glossdef"><p>Alpha is compressed in an S3TC block, much like RG texture
                            compression.</p></dd></dl></div>
            <p>If an image needs to have a varying alpha, the primary difference will be between
                DXT3 and DXT5. DXT5 has the potential for better results, but if the alpha does not
                compress well with the S3TC algorithm, the results will be rather worse than
                DXT3.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e12897"></a>Use Mipmaps Often</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>Mipmapping improves performance when textures are mapped to regions that are
                larger in texel space than in window space. That is, when texture minification
                happens. Mipmapping improves performance because it keeps the locality of texture
                accesses near each other. Texture hardware is optimized for accessing regions of
                textures, so improving locality of texture data will help performance.</p>
            <p>How much this matters depends on how the texture is mapped to the surface. Static
                mapping with explicit texture coordinates, or with linear computation based on
                surface properties, can use mipmapping to improve locality of texture access. For
                more unusual mappings or for pure-lookup tables, mipmapping may not help locality at
                all.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, mipmaps are more likely to help performance when the texture in
                question represents some characteristic of a surface, and is therefore mapped
                directly to that surface. So diffuse textures, normal maps, specular maps, and other
                surface characteristics are all very likely to gain some performance from using
                mipmaps. Projective lights are less likely to gain from this, as it depends on the
                geometry that they are projected onto.</p>
