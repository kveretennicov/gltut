        <p>Before we can begin looking into writing an OpenGL application, we must first know
            what it is that we are writing. What exactly is OpenGL?</p>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e967"></a>OpenGL as an API</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p><em class="glossterm">OpenGL</em> is usually thought of as an Application Programming
                Interface (<acronym class="acronym">API</acronym>). The OpenGL API has been exposed to a number of
                languages. But the one that they all ultimately use at their lowest level is the C
                API.</p>
            <p>The OpenGL API is defined as a state machine. Almost all of the OpenGL functions
                set or retrieve some state in OpenGL. The only functions that do not change state
                are functions that use the currently set state to cause rendering to happen.</p>
            <p>You can think of the state machine as a very large struct with a great many
                different fields. This struct is called the <em class="glossterm">OpenGL context</em>,
                and each field in the context represents some information necessary for
                rendering.</p>
            <p>The API, in C, is defined by a number of typedefs, #defined enumerator values, and
                functions. The typedefs define basic GL types like <span class="type">GLint</span>,
                    <span class="type">GLfloat</span> and so forth. These are defined to have a specific bit
                depth.</p>
            <p><a name="OpenGLObjects"></a>Complex aggregates like structs are never directly exposed
                in OpenGL. Any such constructs are hidden behind the API. This makes it easier to
                expose the OpenGL API to non-C languages without having a complex conversion
                layer.</p>
            <p>In C++, if you wanted an object that contained an integer, a float, and a string,
                you would create it and access it like this:</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">struct Object
{
    int count;
    float opacity;
    char *name;
};

//Create the storage for the object.
Object newObject;

//Put data into the object.
newObject.count = 5;
newObject.opacity = 0.4f;
newObject.name = "Some String";
</pre>
            <p>In OpenGL, you would use an API that looks more like this:</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">//Create the storage for the object
GLuint objectName;
glGenObject(1, &amp;objectName);

//Put data into the object.
glBindObject(GL_MODIFY, objectName);
glObjectParameteri(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_COUNT, 5);
glObjectParameterf(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_OPACITY, 0.4f);
glObjectParameters(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_NAME, "Some String");</pre>
            <p>None of these are actual OpenGL commands, of course. This is simply an example of
                what the interface to such an object would look like.</p>
            <p>OpenGL owns the storage for all OpenGL objects. Because of this, the user can only
                access an object by reference. Almost all OpenGL objects are referred to by an
                unsigned integer (the <span class="type">GLuint</span>). Objects are created by a function of the
                form <code class="function">glGen*</code>, where * is the type of the object. The first
                parameter is the number of objects to create, and the second is a
                    <span class="type">GLuint*</span> array that receives the newly created object names.</p>
            <p>To modify most objects, we must first bind them to the context. Many objects can
                be bound to different locations in the context; this allows the same object to be
                used in different ways. These different locations are called
                    <em class="glossterm">targets</em>; all objects have a list of valid targets, and
                some have only one. In the above example, the fictitious target
                    <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">GL_MODIFY</span>&#8221;</span> is the location where <code class="varname">objectName</code> is
                bound.</p>
            <p>Think of a target like a global pointer. So in our case, the
                    <code class="literal">GL_MODIFY</code> target is just a global pointer that can store an
                object of this type. Calling <code class="literal">glBindObject(GL_MODIFY, objectName)</code>
                is similar to doing this:</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">Object *GL_MODIFY = NULL;

//glBindObject:
GL_MODIFY = ptr(objectName); //Convert object into pointer.</pre>
            <p>OpenGL functions that modify these objects only modify an object that is bound to
                the context. Those function take, as their first parameter, the target of the object
                to modify. This references one of the bound objects.</p>
            <p>The enumerators <code class="literal">GL_OBJECT_*</code> all name fields in the object that
                can be set. The <code class="function">glObjectParameter</code> family of functions set
                parameters within the object bound to the given target. Note that since OpenGL is a
                C API, it has to name each of the differently typed variations differently. So there
                is <code class="function">glObjectParameteri</code> for integer parameters,
                    <code class="function">glObjectParameterf</code> for floating-point parameters, and so
                forth. In terms of code, you can think of these functions as follows:</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">//glObjectParameteri(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_COUNT, 5);
GL_MODIFY-&gt;count = 5;
//glObjectParameterf(GL_MODIFY, GL_OBJECT_OPACITY, 0.4f);
GL_MODIFY-&gt;opacity = 0.4f;
...</pre>
            <p>Binding the object 0 to the a target in the context is the equivalent of setting
                that target's global pointer to <code class="literal">NULL</code>. It unbinds whatever object
                is currently bound to that target.</p>
            <p>Note that all OpenGL objects are not as simple as this example, and the functions
                that change object state do not always follow these naming conventions. We will
                discuss exceptions as we get to them.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e1006"></a>The OpenGL Specification</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>To be technical about it, OpenGL is not an API; it is a specification. A document.
                The C API is merely one way to implement the spec. The specification defines the
                initial OpenGL state, what each function does to change or retrieve that state, and
                what is supposed to happen when you call a rendering function.</p>
            <p>The specification is written by the OpenGL <em class="glossterm">Architectural Review
                    Board</em> (<acronym class="acronym">ARB</acronym>), a group of representatives from
                companies like Apple, NVIDIA, and AMD (the ATI part), among others. The ARB is part
                of the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.khronos.org/" target="_top">Khronos Group</a>.</p>
            <p>The specification is a very complicated and technical document. However, parts of
                it are quite readable, though you will usually need at least some understanding of
                what should be going on to understand it. If you try to read it, the most important
                thing to understand about it is this: it describes <span class="emphasis"><em>results</em></span>, not
                implementation. Just because the spec says that X will happen does not mean that it
                actually does. What it means is that the user should not be able to tell the
                difference. If a piece of hardware can provide the same behavior in a different way,
                then the specification allows this, so long as the user can never tell the
                difference.</p>
            <p>
                <b>OpenGL Implementations.&nbsp;</b>
                While the OpenGL ARB does control the specification, it does not control
                    OpenGL's code. OpenGL is not something you download from a centralized location.
                    For any particular piece of hardware, it is up to the developers of that
                    hardware to write an <em class="glossterm">OpenGL Implementation</em> for that
                    hardware. Implementations, as the name suggests, implement the OpenGL
                    specification, exposing the OpenGL API as defined in the spec.
            </p>
            <p>Who controls the OpenGL implementation is different for different operating
                systems. On Windows, OpenGL implementations are controlled virtually entirely by the
                hardware makers themselves. On Mac OSX, OpenGL implementations are controlled by
                Apple; they decide what version of OpenGL is exposed and what additional
                functionality can be provided to the user. Apple writes much of the OpenGL
                implementation on Mac OSX, which the hardware developers writing to an Apple-created
                internal driver API. On Linux, things are... complicated.</p>
            <p>The long and short of this is that if you are writing a program and it seems to be
                exhibiting off-spec behavior, that is the fault of the maker of your OpenGL
                implementation (assuming it is not a bug in your code). On Windows, the various
                graphics hardware makers put their OpenGL implementations in their regular drivers.
                So if you suspect a bug in their implementation, the first thing you should do is
                make sure your graphics drivers are up-to-date; the bug may have been corrected
                since the last time you updated your drivers.</p>
            <p>
                <b>OpenGL Versions.&nbsp;</b>
                There are many versions of the OpenGL Specification. OpenGL versions are not
                    like most Direct3D versions, which typically change most of the API. Code that
                    works on one version of OpenGL will almost always work on later versions of
                    OpenGL.
            </p>
            <p>The only exception to this deals with OpenGL 3.0 and above, relative to previous
                versions. v3.0 deprecated a number of older functions, and v3.1 removed most of
                those functions from the API<a href="#ftn.d5e1025" class="footnote" name="d5e1025"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a>. This also divided the specification into 2 variations (called
                profiles): core and compatibility. The compatibility profile retains all of the
                functions removed in 3.1, while the core profile does not. Theoretically, OpenGL
                implementations could implement just the core profile; this would leave software
                that relies on the compatibility profile non-functional on that
                implementation.</p>
            <p>As a practical matter, none of this matters at all. No OpenGL driver developer is
                going to ship drivers that only implement the core profile. So in effect, this means
                nothing at all; all OpenGL versions are all effectively backwards compatible.</p>

                        functions. They are still available for use in 3.0.</p>
