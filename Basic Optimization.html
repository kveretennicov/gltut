    <p>Optimization is far too large of a subject to cover adequately in a mere appendix.
        Optimizations tend to be specific to particular algorithms, and they usually involve
        tradeoffs with memory. That is, one can make something run faster by taking up memory. And
        even then, optimizations should only be made when one has proper profiling to determine
        where performance is lacking.</p>
    <p>This appendix will instead cover the most basic optimizations. These are not guaranteed to
        improve performance in any particular program, but they almost never hurt. They are also
        things you can implement relatively easily. Think of these as the default standard practice
        you should start with before performing real optimizations. For the sake of clarity, most of
        the code in this book did not use these practices, so many of them will be new.</p>
    <p>Do as I say, not as I do.</p>
    <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d5e12763"></a>Vertex Format</h2></div></div></div>
        
        <p>Interleave vertex attribute arrays for objects where possible. Obviously, if you need
            to overwrite certain attributes frequently while other attributes remains static, then
            you will need to separate that data. But unless you have some specific need to do so,
            interleave your vertex data.</p>
        <p>Equally importantly, try to use the smallest vertex data possible. Small data means
            that GPU caches are more efficient; they store more vertex attributes per cache line.
            This means fewer direct memory accesses, which means increasing the performance that
            vertex shaders receive their attributes. In this book, the vertex data was almost always
            32-bit floats. You should only use 32-bit floats when you absolutely need that much
            precision.</p>
        <p>The biggest key to this is the use of normalized integer values for attributes. As a
            reminder for how this works, here is the definition of
                <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code>:</p>
        <div class="funcsynopsis">
            <table border="0" class="funcprototype-table" summary="Function synopsis" style="cellspacing: 0; cellpadding: 0;"><tr><td><code class="funcdef">void <b class="fsfunc">glVertexAttribPointer</b>(</code></td><td>GLuint <var class="pdparam">index</var>, </td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>GLint <var class="pdparam">size</var>, </td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>GLenum <var class="pdparam">type</var>, </td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>GLboolean <var class="pdparam">normalized</var>, </td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>GLsizei <var class="pdparam">stride</var>, </td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>GLvoid *<var class="pdparam">pointer</var><code>)</code>;</td></tr></table><div class="funcprototype-spacer">&nbsp;</div>
        </div>
        <p>If <code class="varname">type</code> is an integer attribute, like
                <code class="varname">GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE</code>, then setting <code class="varname">normalized</code> to
                <code class="literal">GL_TRUE</code> will mean that OpenGL interprets the integer value as
            normalized. It will automatically convert the integer 255 to 1.0, and so forth. If the
            normalization flag is false instead, then it will convert the integers directly to
            floats: 255 becomes 255.0, etc. Signed values can be normalized as well; GL_BYTE with
            normalization will map 127 to 1.0, -128 to -1.0, etc.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Colors.&nbsp;</b>
            Color values are commonly stored as 4 unsigned normalized bytes. This is far
                smaller than using 4 32-bit floats, but the loss of precision is almost always
                negligible. To send 4 unsigned normalized bytes, use:
        </p>
        <pre class="programlisting">glVertexAttribPointer(#, 4, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, GL_TRUE, ...);</pre>
        <p>The best part is that all of this is free; it costs no actual performance. Note
            however that 32-bit integers cannot be normalized.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, color values need higher precision than 8-bits, but less than 16-bits. If a
            color is in the linear RGB colorspace, it is often desirable to give them greater than
            8-bit precision. If the alpha of the color is negligible or non-existent, then a special
                <code class="varname">type</code> can be used. This type is
                <code class="literal">GL_UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV</code>. It takes 32-bit unsigned
            normalized integers and pulls the four components of the attributes out of each integer.
            This type can only be used with normalization:</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">glVertexAttribPointer(#, 4, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, GL_TRUE, ...);</pre>
        <p>The most significant 2 bits of each integer is the Alpha. The next 10 bits are the
            Blue, then Green, and finally Red. Make note of the fact that it is reversed. It is
            equivalent to this bitfield struct in C:</p>
        <pre class="programlisting">struct RGB10_A2
{
  unsigned int alpha    : 2;
  unsigned int blue     : 10;
  unsigned int green    : 10;
  unsigned int red      : 10;
};</pre>
        <p>
            <b>Normals.&nbsp;</b>
            Another attribute where precision isn't of paramount importance is normals. If the
                normals are normalized, and they always should be, the coordinates are always going
                to be on the [-1, 1] range. So signed normalized integers are appropriate here.
                8-bits of precision are sometimes enough, but 10-bit precision is going to be an
                improvement. 16-bit precision, <code class="literal">GL_SHORT</code>, may be overkill, so
                stick with <code class="literal">GL_INT_2_10_10_10_REV</code> (the signed version of the
                above). Because this format provides 4 values, you will need to use 4 as the size of
                the attribute, but you can still use <span class="type">vec3</span> in the shader as the normal's
                input variable.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Texture Coordinates.&nbsp;</b>
            Two-dimensional texture coordinates do not typically need 32-bits of precision. 8
                and 10-bit precision are usually not good enough, but 16-bit unsigned normalized
                integers are often sufficient. If texture coordinates range outside of [0, 1], then
                normalization will not be sufficient. In these cases, there is an alternative to
                32-bit floats: 16-bit floats.
        </p>
        <p>The hardest part of dealing with 16-bit floats is that C/C++ does not deal with very
            well. There is no native 16-bit float type, unlike virtually every other type. Even the
            10-bit format can be built using bit selectors in structs, as above. Generating a 16-bit
            float from a 32-bit float requires care, as well as an understanding of how
            floating-point values work.</p>
        <p>This is where the GLM math library comes in handy. It has the <span class="type">glm::thalf</span>,
            which is a type that represents a 16-bit floating-point value. It has overloaded
            operators, so that it can be used like a regular <span class="type">float</span>. GLM also provides
                <span class="type">glm::hvec</span> and <span class="type">glm::hmat</span> types for vectors and matrices,
            respectively.</p>
        <p>
            <b>Positions.&nbsp;</b>
            In general, positions are the least likely attribute to be easily optimized
                without consequence. 16-bit floats can be used, but these are restricted to a range
                of approximately [-6550.4, 6550.4]. They also lack some precision, which may be
                necessary depending on the size and detail of the object in model space.
        </p>
        <p>If 16-bit floats are insufficient, a certain form of compression can be used. The
            process is as follows:</p>
        <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem">
                <p>When loading the mesh data, find the bounding volume of the mesh in model
                    space. To do this, find the maximum and minimum values in the X, Y and Z
                    directions independently. This represents a rectangle in model space that
                    contains all of the vertices. This rectangle is defined by two 3D vectors: the
                    maximum vector (containing the max X, Y and Z values), and the minimum vector.
                    These are named <code class="varname">max</code> and <code class="varname">min</code>.</p>
            </li><li class="listitem">
                <p>Compute the center point of this region:</p>
                <pre class="programlisting">glm::vec3 center = (max + min) / 2.0f;</pre>
            </li><li class="listitem">
                <p>Compute half of the size (width, height, depth) of the region:</p>

            </li><li class="listitem">
                <p>For each position in the mesh, compute a normalized version by subtracting the

                <pre class="programlisting">glm::vec3 newPosition = (position - center) / halfSize;</pre>
            </li><li class="listitem">
                <p>For each new position, convert it to a signed, normalized integer by

unsigned short normY = (unsigned short)(newPosition.y * 32767.0f);
unsigned short normZ = (unsigned short)(newPosition.z * 32767.0f);</pre>
                <p>These three coordinates are then stored as the new position data in the buffer
                    object.</p>
            </li><li class="listitem">
                <p>Keep the <code class="varname">center</code> and <code class="varname">halfSize</code> variables
                    stored with your mesh data. When computing the model-space to camera-space
                    matrix for that mesh, add one final matrix to the top. This matrix will perform
                    the inverse operation from the one that we used to compute the normalized
                    values:</p>
                <pre class="programlisting">matrixStack.Translate(center);
matrixStack.Scale(halfSize);</pre>
                <p>This final matrix should <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be applied to the normal's
                    matrix. Compute the normal matrix <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> applying the final
                    step above. So if you were not using a separate matrix for normals (you did not
                    have non-uniform scales in your model-to-camera matrix), you will need to use
                    one now. So this may make your data bigger or make your shader run slightly
                    slower.</p>
            </li></ol></div>
        <p>
            <b>Alignment.&nbsp;</b>
            One additional rule you should always follow is this: make sure that all
                attributes begin on a 4-byte boundary. This is true for attributes that are smaller
                than 4-bytes, such as a 3-vector of 8-bit values. While OpenGL will allow you to use
                arbitrary alignments, hardware may have problems making it work. So if you make your
                3D position data 16-bit floats or 16-bit signed normalized integers, you will still
                waste 2 bytes from every position. You may want to try making your position values
                4-dimensional values and putting something useful in the W component.
