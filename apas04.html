        <p>The absolute best tool to have in your repertoire for optimizing your rendering is
            finding out why your rendering is slow.</p>
        <p>GPUs are designed as a pipeline. Each stage in the pipeline is functionally
            independent from the other. A vertex shader can be computing some number of vertices,
            while the clipping and rasterization are working on other triangles, while the fragment
            shader is working on fragments generated by other triangles.</p>
        <p>However, a vertex generated by the vertex shader cannot pass to the rasterizer if the
            rasterizer is busy. Similarly, the rasterizer cannot generate more fragments if all of
            the fragment shaders are in use. Therefore, the overall performance of the GPU can only
            be the performance of the slowest step in the pipeline.</p>
        <p>This means that, in order to actually make the GPU faster, you must find the
            particular stage of the pipeline that is the slowest. This step is referred to as the
                <em class="glossterm">bottleneck</em>. Until you know what the bottleneck is, then the
            most you can do is take a guess as to why things are slower than you think they are. And
            doing major code changes based purely on a guess is probably not something you can do.
            At least, not until you have a lot of experience with the GPU(s) in question.</p>
        <p>It should also be noted that bottlenecks are not consistent throughout the rendering
            of a single frame. Some parts of it can be CPU bound, others can be fragment shader
            bound, etc. Thus, attempt to find particular sections of rendering that likely have the
            same problem before trying to find the bottleneck.</p>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e12955"></a>Measuring Performance</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>The most common performance statistic you see when most people talk about
                performance is frames per second (<acronym class="acronym">FPS</acronym>). While this is useful when
                talking to the lay person, a graphics programmer does not use FPS as their standard
                performance metric. It is the overall goal, but when measuring the actual
                performance of a piece of rendering code, the more useful metric is simply time.
                This is usually measured in milliseconds (ms).</p>
            <p>If you are attempting to maintain 60fps, that translates to having 16.67
                milliseconds to spend performing all rendering tasks.</p>
            <p>One thing that confounds performance metrics is the fact that the GPU is both
                pipelined and asynchronous. When running regular code, if you call a function,
                you're usually assured that the actions the function took have all completed when it
                returns. When you issue a rendering call (any <code class="function">glDraw*</code>
                function), not only is it likely that rendering has not completed by the time it has
                returned, it is very likely that rendering has not even
                <span class="emphasis"><em>started</em></span>. Not even doing a buffer swap will ensure that the GPU
                has finished, as GPUs can wait to actual perform the buffer swap until later.</p>
            <p>If you specifically want to time the GPU, then you must force the GPU to finish
                its work. To do that in OpenGL, you call a function cleverly titled
                    <code class="function">glFinish</code>. It will return sometime after the GPU finishes.
                Note that it does not guarantee that it returns immediately after, only at some
                point after the GPU has finished all of its commands. So it is a good idea to give
                the GPU a healthy workload before calling finish, to minimize the difference between
                the time you measure and the time the GPU actually has.</p>
            <p>You will also want to turn vertical synchronization, or vsync, off. There is a
                certain point during which a graphics chip is able to swap the front and back
                framebuffers with a guarantee of not causing half of the displayed image to be from
                one buffer and half from another. The latter eventuality is called
                    <em class="glossterm">tearing</em>, and having vsync enabled avoids that. However,
                you do not care about tearing; you want to know about performance. So you need to
                turn off any form of vsync.</p>
            <p>Vsync is controlled by the window-system specific extensions
                    <code class="literal">GLX_EXT_swap_control</code> and
                    <code class="literal">WGL_EXT_swap_control</code>. They both do the same thing and have
                similar APIs. The <code class="function">wgl/glxSwapInterval</code> functions take an integer
                that tells how many vsyncs to wait between swaps. If you pass 0, then it will swap
                immediately.</p>

        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e12971"></a>Possible Bottlenecks</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>There are several potential bottlenecks that a section of rendering code can have.
                We will list those and the ways of determining if it is the bottleneck. You should
                test these in the order presented below.</p>
            <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e12974"></a>Fragment Processing</h4></div></div></div>
                
                <p>This is probably the easiest to find. The quantity of fragment processing you
                    have depends entirely on the number of fragments the various triangles are
                    rasterized to. Therefore, simply increase the resolution. If you increase the
                    resolution by 2x the number of pixels (double either the width or height), and
                    the time to render doubles, then you are fragment processing bound.</p>
                <p>Note that rendering time will go up when you increase the resolution. What you
                    are interested in is whether it goes up linearly with the number of fragments
                    rendered. If the rendering time only goes up by 1.2x with a 2x increase in
                    number of fragments, then the code was not entirely fragment processing
                    bound.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e12978"></a>Vertex Processing</h4></div></div></div>
                
                <p>If you are not fragment processing bound, then there's a good chance you are
                    vertex processing bound. After ruling out fragment processing, simply turn off
                    all fragment processing. If this does not increase your performance
                    significantly (there will generally be some change), then you were vertex
                    processing bound.</p>
                <p>To turn off fragment processing, simply
                        <code class="function">glEnable</code>(<code class="literal">GL_RASTERIZER_DISCARD&#8203;</code>).
                    This will cause all fragments to be discarded. Obviously, nothing will be
                    rendered, but all of the steps before rasterization will still be executed.
                    Therefore, your performance timings will be for vertex processing alone.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d5e12984"></a>CPU</h4></div></div></div>
                
                <p>A CPU bottleneck means that the GPU is being starved; it is consuming data
                    faster than the CPU is providing it. You do not really test for CPU bottlenecks
                    per-se; they are discovered by process of elimination. If nothing else is
                    bottlenecking the GPU, then the CPU clearly is not giving it enough stuff to
                    do.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e12987"></a>Unfixable Bottlenecks</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>It is entirely possible that you cannot fix a bottleneck. Maybe there's simply no
                way to avoid a vertex-processing heavy section of your renderer. Perhaps you need
                all of that fragment processing in a certain area of rendering.</p>
            <p>If there is some bottleneck that cannot be optimized away, then turn it to your
                advantage by increasing the complexity of the other stages in the pipeline. If you
                have an unfixable CPU bottleneck, then render more detailed models. If you have a
                vertex-shader bottleneck, improve your lighting by adding some fragment-shader
                complexity. And so forth. Just make sure that you do not increase complexity to the
                point where you move the bottleneck and make things slower.</p>
