        <p>This is a book for beginning graphics programmers; it can also serve as a good
            introductory text for those familiar with fixed function-based graphics who want to
            understand programmable rendering better.</p>
        <p>What this book is not is a book for beginning <span class="emphasis"><em>programmers</em></span>.</p>
        <p>You are expected to be able to read C and reasonable C++ code. If <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Hello,
                world!</span>&#8221;</span> is the extent of your C/C++ knowledge, then perhaps you should write
            some more substantial code before proceeding with trying to render images. 3D graphics
            rendering is simply not a beginner programming task; this is just as true for
            traditional graphics learning as for modern graphics learning.</p>
        <p>These tutorials should be transferable to other languages as well. If you can read
            C/C++, that is enough to understand what the code is doing. The text descriptions that
            explain what the code does are also sufficient to get information out of these
            tutorials.</p>
        <p>Any substantial discussion of 3D rendering requires a discussion of mathematics, which
            are at the foundation of all 3D graphics. This book expects you to know basic geometry
            and algebra. This book will present the more advanced math needed for graphics as it
            becomes necessary. But you should have at least a working knowledge of geometry and
            algebra. Linear algebra is not required.</p>
        <p>The source code in this book use OpenGL as its rendering API. You do not need to know
            OpenGL when starting, but in order to compile and run any of this code, you must have a
            development environment that allows OpenGL.</p>
        <p>Specifically, you will need graphics hardware capable of running OpenGL version 3.3.
            This means any GeForce 8xxx or better, or any Radeon HD-class card. These are also
            called <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Direct3D 10</span>&#8221;</span> cards, but you do not need Windows Vista or 7 to use
            their advanced features through OpenGL. You should have the most recent version of
            graphics drivers installed, available on the home page of your graphics card
            manufacturer. Outside of drivers and the actual tutorial distribution, you will not need
            to download or install anything else to work with OpenGL.</p>

            <p>This book is intended to teach graphics programmers the basics of graphics
                development. The most important thing you can bring within yourself is a willingness
                to learn. This also means leaving preconceived notions, and most importantly of all,
                not trying to learn anything in particular.</p>
            <p>Often, programmers will scour the internet or pour over books, looking for
                information about how to perform some specific task. Once they find it, they will
                try to copy that code into their application and see if they can make it work. This
                method can achieve results faster, but it impairs learning by focusing on achieving
                a certain effect goal instead of truly understanding how it works.</p>
            <p>When first approaching this book, you should try to avoid thinking about any
                specific problem. You may keep a particular problem in the back of your mind, but do
                not allow the search for a solution to drive your reading. Instead, focus on the
                material being presented. Once you have finished the book, then you can look back
                and see if you understand how to solve that problem you wanted to solve.</p>
            <p>You may find that you have a better solution than you would have thought of
                otherwise.</p>
