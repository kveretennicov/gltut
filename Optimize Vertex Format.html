        <p>Vertex attributes stored in buffer objects can be of a surprisingly large number of
            formats. These tutorials generally used 32-bit floating-point data, but that is far from
            the best case.</p>
        <p>The <em class="glossterm">vertex format</em> specifically refers to the set of values
            given to the <code class="function">glVertexAttribPointer</code> calls that describe how each
            attribute is aligned in the buffer object.</p>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e12997"></a>Attribute Formats</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>Each attribute should take up as little room as possible. This is for performance
                reasons, but it also saves memory. For buffer objects, these are usually one in the
                same. The less data you have stored in memory, the faster it gets to the vertex
                shader.</p>
            <p>Attributes can be stored in normalized integer formats, just like textures. This
                is most useful for colors and texture coordinates. For example, to have an attribute
                that is stored in 4 unsigned normalized bytes, you can use this:</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">glVertexAttribPointer(index, 4, GLubyte, GLtrue, 0, offset);</pre>
            <p>If you want to store a normal as a normalized signed short, you can use
                this:</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">glVertexAttribPointer(index, 3, GLushort, GLtrue, 0, offset);</pre>
            <p>There are also a few specialized formats. <code class="literal">GL_HALF_FLOAT</code> can be
                used for 16-bit floating-point types. This is useful for when you need values
                outside of [-1, 1], but do not need the full </p>
            <p>Non-normalized integers can be used as well. These map in GLSL directly to
                floating-point values, so a non-normalized value of 16 maps to a GLSL value of
                16.0.</p>
            <p>The best thing about all of these formats is that they cost
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>nothing</em></span> in performance to use. They are all silently
                converted into floating-point values for consumption by the vertex shader, with no
                performance lost.</p>

        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e13009"></a>Interleaved Attributes</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>Attributes do not all have to come from the same buffer object; multiple
                attributes can come from multiple buffers. However, where possible, this should be
                avoided. Furthermore, attributes in the same buffer should be interleaved with one
                another whenever possible.</p>
            <p>Consider an array of structs in C++:</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">struct Vertex
{
  float position[3];
  GLubyte color[4];
  GLushort texCoord[2];
}

Vertex vertArray[20];</pre>
            <p>The byte offset of <code class="varname">color</code> in the <span class="type">Vertex</span> struct is
                12. That is, from the beginning of the <span class="type">Vertex</span> struct, the
                    <code class="varname">color</code> variable starts 12 bytes in. The
                    <code class="varname">texCoord</code> variable starts 16 bytes in.</p>
            <p>If we did a memcpy between <code class="varname">vertArray</code> and a buffer object, and
                we wanted to set the attributes to pull from this data, we could do so using the
                stride and offsets to position things properly.</p>
            <pre class="programlisting">glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GLfalse, 20, 0);
glVertexAttribPointer(1, 3, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, GL_TRUE, 20, 12);
glVertexAttribPointer(3, 3, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, GL_TRUE, 20, 16);</pre>
            <p>The fifth argument is the stride. The stride is the number of bytes from the
                beginning of one instance of this attribute to the beginning of another. The stride
                here is set to <code class="literal">sizeof</code>(<span class="type">Vertex</span>). C++ defines that the
                size of a struct represents the byte offset between separate instances of that
                struct in an array. So that is our stride.</p>
            <p>The offsets represent where in the buffer object the first element is. These match
                the offsets in the struct. If we had loaded this data to a location past the front
                of our buffer object, we would need to offset these values by the beginning of where
                we uploaded our data to.</p>
            <p>There are certain gotchas when deciding how data gets packed like this. First, it
                is a good idea to keep every attribute on a 4-byte alignment. This may mean
                introducing explicit padding (empty space) into your structures. Some hardware will
                have massive slowdowns if things are not aligned to four bytes.</p>
            <p>Next, it is a good idea to keep the size of any interleaved vertex data restricted
                to multiples of 32 bytes in size. Violating this is not as bad as violating the
                4-byte alignment rule, but one can sometimes get sub-optimal performance if the
                total size of interleaved vertex data is, for example, 48 bytes. Or 20 bytes, as in
                our example.</p>

        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e13029"></a>Packing Suggestions</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>If the smallest vertex data size is what you need, consider these packing
                techniques.</p>
            <p>Colors generally do not need to be more than 3-4 bytes in size. One byte per
                component.</p>
            <p>Texture coordinates, particularly those clamped to the [0, 1] range, almost never
                need more than 16-bit precision. So use unsigned shorts.</p>
            <p>Normals should be stored in the signed 2_10_10_10 format whenever possible.
                Normals generally do not need that much precisions, especially since you're going to
                normalize them anyway. This format was specifically devised for normals, so use
                it.</p>
            <p>Positions are the trickiest to work with, because the needs vary so much. If you
                are willing to modify your vertex shaders and put some work into it, you can often
                use 16-bit signed normalized shorts.</p>
            <p>The key to this is a special scale/translation matrix. When you are preparing your
                data, in an offline tool, you take the floating-point positions of a model and
                determine the model's maximum extents in all three axes. This forms a bounding box
                around the model. The center of the box is the center of your new model, and you
                apply a translation to move the points to this center. Then you apply a non-uniform
                scale to transform the points from their extent range to the [-1, 1] range of signed
                normalized values. You save the offset and the scales you used as part of your mesh
                data (not to be stored in the buffer object).</p>
            <p>When it comes time to render the model, you simply reverse the transformation. You
                build a scale/translation matrix that undoes what was done to get them into the
                signed-normalized range. Note that this matrix should not be applied to the normals,
                because the normals were not compressed this way. A fully matrix multiply is even
                overkill for this transformation; a scale+translation can be done with a simple
                vector multiply and add.</p>
