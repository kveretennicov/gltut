        <p>These optimizations all have to do with the concept of objects. An object, for the
            purpose of this discussion, is a combination of a mesh, program, uniform data, and set
            of textures used to render some specific thing in the world.</p>
        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e12905"></a>Object Culling</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>A virtual world consists of many objects. The more objects we draw, the longer
                rendering takes.</p>
            <p>One major optimization is also a very simple one: render only what must be
                rendered. There is no point in drawing an object in the world that is not actually
                visible. Thus, the task here is to, for each object, detect if it would be visible;
                if it is not, then it is not rendered. This process is called visiblity culling or
                object culling.</p>
            <p>As a first pass, we can say that objects that are not within the view frustum are
                not visible. This is called frustum culling, for obvious reasons. Determining that
                an object is off screen is generally a CPU task. Each object must be represented by
                a simple volume, such as a sphere or camera-space box. These objects are used
                because they are relatively easy to test against the view frustum; if they are
                within the frustum, then the corresponding object is considered visible.</p>
            <p>Of course, this only boils the scene down to the objects in front of the camera.
                Objects that are entirely occluded by other objects will still be rendered. There
                are a number of techniques for detecting whether objects obstruct the view of other
                objects. Portals, BSPs, and a variety of other techniques involve preprocessing
                certain static terrain to determine visibility sets. Therefore it can be known that,
                when the camera is in a certain region of the world, objects in certain other
                regions cannot be visible even if they are within the view frustum.</p>
            <p>A more fine-grained solution involves using a hardware feature called occlusion
                queries. This is a way to render an object and then ask how many fragments of that
                object were actually rasterized. If even one fragment passed the depth test
                (assuming all possible occluding surfaces have been rendered), then the object is
                visible and must be rendered.</p>
            <p>It is generally preferred to render simple test objects, such that if any part of
                the test object is visible, then the real object will be visible. Drawing a test
                object is much faster than drawing a complex hierarchial model with specialized
                skinning vertex shaders. Write masks (set with <code class="function">glColorMask</code> and
                    <code class="function">glDepthMask</code>) are used to prevent writing the fragment
                shader outputs of the test object to the framebuffer. Thus, the test object is only
                tested against the depth buffer, not actually rendered.</p>
            <p>Occlusion queries in OpenGL are objects that have state. They are created with the
                    <code class="function">glGenQueries</code> function. To start rendering a test object for
                occlusion queries, the object generated from <code class="function">glGenQueries</code> is
                passed to the <code class="function">glBeginQuery</code> function, along with the mode of
                    <code class="literal">GL_SAMPLES_PASSED</code>. All rendering commands between
                    <code class="function">glBeginQuery</code> and the corresponding
                    <code class="function">glEndQuery</code> are part of the test object. If all of the
                fragments of the object were discarded (via depth buffer or something else), then
                the query failed. If even one fragment was rendered, then it passed.</p>
            <p>This can be used with a concept called conditional rendering. This is exactly what
                it says: rendering an object conditionally. It allows a series of rendering
                commands, bracketed by
                    <code class="function">glBeginConditionalRender</code>/<code class="function">glEndConditionalRender</code>
                functions, to cause the execution of those rendering commands to happen or not
                happen based on the status of an occlusion query object. If the occlusion query
                passed, then the rendering commands will be executed. If it did not, then they will
                not be.</p>
            <p>Of course, conditional rendering can cause pipeline stalls; OpenGL still requires
                that operations execute in-order, even conditional ones. So all later operations
                will be held up if a conditional render is waiting for its occlusion query to
                finish. To avoid this, you can specify <code class="literal">GL_QUERY_NO_WAIT</code> when
                beginning the conditional render. This will cause OpenGL to render if the query has
                not completed before this conditional render is ready to be rendered. To gain the
                maximum benefit from this, it is best to render the conditional objects well after
                the test objects they are conditioned on.</p>

        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e12927"></a>Model LOD</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>When a model is far away, it does not need to look as detailed, since most of the
                details will be lost due to lack of resolution. Therefore, one can substitute more
                detailed models for less detailed ones. This is commonly referred to as Level of
                Detail (<acronym class="acronym">LOD</acronym>).</p>
            <p>Of course in modern rendering, detail means more than just the number of polygons
                in a mesh. It can often mean what shader to use, what textures to use with it, etc.
                So while meshes will often have LODs, so will shaders. Textures have their own
                built-in LODing mechanism in mip-mapping. But it is often the case that low-LOD
                shaders (those used from far away) do not need as many textures as the closer LOD
                shaders. You might be able to get away with per-vertex lighting for distant models,
                while you need per-fragment lighting for those close up.</p>
            <p>The problem with this visually is how to deal with the transitions between LOD
                levels. If you change them too close to the camera, then the user will notice a pop.
                If you do them too far away, you lose much of the performance gain from rendering a
                low-detail mesh far away. Finding a good middle-ground is key.</p>

        <div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d5e12933"></a>State Changes</h3></div></div></div>
            
            <p>OpenGL has three kinds of functions: those that actually do rendering, those that
                retrieve information from OpenGL, and those that modify some information stored in
                OpenGL. The vast majority of OpenGL functions are the latter. OpenGL's information
                is generally called <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">state,</span>&#8221;</span> and needlessly changing state can be
                expensive.</p>
            <p>Therefore, this optimization rule is to, as best as possible, minimize the number
                of state changes. For simple scenes, this can be trivial. But in a complicated,
                data-driven environment, this can be exceedingly complex.</p>
            <p>The general idea is to gather up a list of all objects that need to be rendered
                (after culling non-visible objects and performing any LOD work), then sort them
                based on their shared state. Objects that use the same program share program state,
                for example. By doing this, if you render the objects in state order, you will
                minimize the number of changes to OpenGL state.</p>
            <p>The three most important pieces of state to sort by are the ones that change most
                frequently: programs (and their associated uniforms), textures, and VAO state.
                Global state, such as face culling, blending, etc, are less expensive because they
                don't change as often. Generally, all meshes use the same culling parameters,
                viewport settings, depth comparison state, and so forth.</p>
            <p>Minimizing vertex array state changes generally requires more than just sorting;
                it requires changing how mesh data is stored. This book usually gives every mesh its
                own VAO, which represents its own separate state. This is certainly very convenient,
                but it can work against performance if the CPU is a bottleneck.</p>
            <p>To avoid this, try to group meshes that have the same vertex data formats in the
                same buffer objects and VAOs. This makes it possible to render several objects, with
                several different <code class="function">glDraw*</code> commands, all using the same VAO
                state. <code class="function">glDrawElementsBaseVertex</code> is very useful for this purpose
                when rendering with indexed data. The fewer VAO binds, the better.</p>
            <p>There is less information on how harmful uniform state changes are to performance,
                or the performance difference between changing in-program uniforms and buffer-based
                uniforms.</p>
            <p>Be advised that state sorting cannot help when dealing with blending, because
                blending correctness requires sorting based on depth. Thus, it is necessary to avoid
                that.</p>
            <p>There are also certain tricky states that can hurt, depending on hardware. For
                example, it is best to avoid changing the direction of the depth test once you have
                cleared the depth buffer and started rendering to it. This is for reasons having to
                do with specific hardware optimizations of depth buffering.</p>
